# coalition

This is the source code used in the paper "Lazy Nested Monte Carlo Search for Coalition Structure Generation" presented at ICAART in february 2024.

You can run the various methods implemented in this article by uncommenting them in the main. Make sure the method you want to use uses the right type of playouts, imports the right search space (model) class (coalition, coalitionPERM and coalitionsB), and that the search space class uses the right evaluation function. All of these are defined at the top of the search space and method files.

You can find our uncurated results in the result folder. Each line gives the time of the new best score (left), and the new best score (right).
